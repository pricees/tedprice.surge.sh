WARNING: This is pretty nasty stuff.


My upstairs toilet *was* slow to flush and drain. It wasn't clogged, per se, but it did fill up with water, only to drain after 30 seconds.

My wife had mentioned the issue, however I didn't realize how bad it was until I saw for myself.

As a new standard, instead of calling plumber, I went straight to the Youtubes.

Ole' Johnny Fix It, or whatever his hname is, said a one solution may be to get Drano/Liquid
Plumber, fill up the bowl. Let it sit for about 15 minutes and then flush it down with a pot of hot
water. Repeat as needed. Also, add dishwasher soap to the overflow tube as to break down the gunk in
the pipes.

I followed these instructions, but did not get any satisfying results.

Nex stop? My local hardware store and got a 6-feet snake. I was also told that it could be a toy
down there, and to stop using Drano. If Drano hasn't unclogged after one time, more Drano ain't gonna work.

I also fetched my plunger from the basement.

With my trusty tools, I went to battle. Diswashing soap was added to the overflow tube, that seemed
like a reasonable idea. Then I added many pots of scadling water to the toilet. This seemed wise as
well.

Next I took the snake and sent it lurking into the depths of the turd chute. After a few
minutes, I hit paydirt. I pulled out a sugar-daddy the likes ye has never seen! I almost threw
up.

The time to drain the toilet showed marked improved. The toilet even made a real flushing nows.
However, it was not a "bah-wooosh" that I longed for.

I snaked for a bit more. Then plunged. Snake. Plunge. Snake. Plunge. Lots of snastiness came up.
I added more, and more, hot water, whilst letting the dishwashing soap do it's thing.

I was done after 30 minutes of work. The toilet sat as is for a day.

The following morning, the pipes were completely clear and the toilet flushed like ~~poo~~ new.

Another adventure of home ownership in the books, ladies and germs.


### BA-WOOOOOSH!!!
