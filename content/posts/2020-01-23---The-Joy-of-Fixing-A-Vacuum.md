description: "I 'fixed' my vacuum"

To celebrate Martin Luther King Day, I had big plans. I was going to read, have a cigar, and sit by
the fire. What I did, instead, was clean the house, go to the doctor, and clean somemore.

So much for plans.

When I was done picking up most of the clothes and toys off the floor, I grabbed the vacuum and fired
it up. The motor was making a noise but nothing, absolutely nothing, was being sucked up. The first thing I thought
was: "well, I guess I better go price a used vacuum on Craigslist and compare that with a new vacuum. This was is broke."

The vacuum in question was a Dyson DC33, $250. And the used ones on Craigslist were not much
cheaper. It was time to actually figure out how to fix the vacuum.

I watched a few Youtube videos on disassembling the DC33, checking all of the parts. I found no clogs.

I disassembled the brushroll and removed all of the hair. I secured the brushroll, belt, and coverplate back into place.

Still no suction.

The Youtube videos discussed the pre- and
post- motor filters. I disassembled the filter covers adn I took them out. They were completely disgusting. Apparently these filters should be cleaned every 3 months. We purchased the vacuum two and a half years ago and hadn't done anything to it.

I noticed was that one of the filter's seals was broken. Clearly this was a problem. Cleaning the filters is one thing but the integrity of the filter itself was not fixable. I went ahead and purchased new filters for $14. Lo' and behold, the vacuum was "fixed" after inserting the new filters.

Lastly, the brushroll had "stopped spinning" when I would turn the vacuum on. I assumed it was because I burnt out that piece of the motor after years of abuse. I was resigned to replacing the cluth. When reading about how to replace the clutch, I was struck to find out _that in the upright position, the brushroll is disengaged_. As soon as I unlocked the vacuum
from the upright position, by using the vacuum, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the roller
spun as expected.

The vacuum is in good shape. And all it took was a $14 filter and the willingness to learn how it
all works.

#### Conclusion

I do not claim to be a smart man. Nor, do I claim to have any common sense. What I am
realizing -- aside from not being a real adult -- is that (a) I need to become acquainted with the proper care and maintenance of all my
tools and purchases (b) before looking for a replacement, assume it can be fixed with minor effort, and (c) everything can be found on the internet.
