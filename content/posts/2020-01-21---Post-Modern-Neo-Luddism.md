### My new phone.

I have a phone. It's a flip phone. It's a [Kyocera Cadence](/pages/contacts), I purchased it, two weeks ago, off Craigslist. The phone retails for $160, but I got it for a cool $40 even.

It has a small screen. I cannot see pictures on it.
It has a 2MB camera. So there goes that feature.
The browser experience is not good and insufficient for the modern web.
No podcasts. No apps. The T9 predictive text feature, while awesome in the mid 2000s, provides enough friction that I make phone calls for anything that cannot be written in a few words.

My biggest fear, losing Google Maps, or getting lost, has turned out to be more of a boogie man than a reality.

I write driving directions down on paper. I haven't noticed  taking clever backroads to shave 1 minute off a drive. I sit in traffic not knowing when I will get to my destination. Not knowing has been liberating.

### My old Android.

I still have it. It's connected to my Google Voice account. However, _requiring wifi_ provides enough friction that I do not take it anywhere. I can, conceivably, make phone calls from it. I take pictures with it and upload those to [Likecake](https://lifecake.com) and text those pictures over Google Voice to my contacts I can Google Duo with my family and Youtube videos. I do find myself looking at the browser a great deal, when waking up, as I still use it for an alarm clock and white noise maker. However, for all intents and purposes, it is a 5" Androidn tablet, with a shattered screen. It stays at home.

### Replacing the Android Phone

#### Podcasts / Music

I work remote. I don't need Spotify for my driving pleasure.

I purchased a $19 MP3 player, 1.2 oz, off Amazon. It's a piece of junk. And it works great! Every morning, I download fresh podcast episodes using [PodFox](https://github.com/brtmr/podfox) and transfer them to my mp3 player.

The content is either there or it's not. If I am not interested in the content I have downloaded, I turn the player off. This means that when I am on a run, in the car, or at the gym, there is little fiddling or searching.

#### Maps

As mentioned earlier, I write non-trivial driving directions down on paper. The upshot is that I have started memorizing my surroundings and have become comfortable with highway exit and route numbers. I was pleasantly surprised how that muscle came right back.

#### Camera

For my birthday, I have asked my wife for a wifi-enabled Elph 190. We shall see how this goes.

#### Notes

Got a Field Notes booklet. I have yet to need it. But it's there.

##### White/Rain noise

I need a white noise maker. Maybe I can just take my sons.

### The consequences of downgrading my phone

The first thing I noticed was that I was ~~more~~ present and engaged with my children. Even when I wasn't directly engaged and an active participant in their playtime, I was not -- as previously for the past 4 years -- actively looking at my phone. This accomplished my primary motivation for switching to a dumb phone.

By not being passively or actively engaged in my phone, I have found myself feeling a new sense of awakeness. With my kids, regardless of activity, driving on the road, going out for meals with others or by myself, the obsession with distraction has been removed. I have begun to embrace boredom and pondering, once again.

Lastly, I have gone back to almost exclusively talking to other humans rather than texting. 

### Conclusion

Clearly I have my biases. I couldn't handle the responsibility of having a smart phone, so I gave it up. No judgment for those of you who think me weak or stupid. Using a dumb phone has been great for the first 2 weeks and I hope to continue writing about the new (old) ways of doing things, new perceptions, and experiences.
