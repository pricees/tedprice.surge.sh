## tdl;dr

- Make sure I have the tools to be productive at home
- Isolate myself from distractions at home
- Do not isolate myself from my team
- Communication and over communication leads to effective collaboration
- Write everything down in a shared space. Verify the team members are aware of how to access these documents.
- Utilize all communication tools to move forward with projects and day-to-day tasks, but make sure that important information lands in the shared space as a source-of-truth for these projects and tasks
- Write documents as if I am leaving for a few weeks. Replace ambiguity with certainty where possible. Remove verbosity. Be succinct and to the point
- Wherever possible, write with enough clarity and detail to remove myself from the next steps, if possible.
- Ask questions, ask for clarity, double-check my assumptions. In-person communication can be difficult. Distance between team members tends to complicate communication
- Check in with my team often, so that they know when I am available and when I am not
- Engage with team members in a way that recreates the office dynamic that makes working at Centro such fun

## My home office setup
- 27" 4K Monitor. Can you take your monitor home? Otherwise buy one here: https://is.gd/ziQXqw
- Get a desk, any desk will do, but mine is an Ikea standing desk. Amazon has good desks.
- A webcam. Any will do. Logitech 1080p webcam. We do lots of video chats. $160: https://is.gd/EFdSOL -- your laptop cam should be good enough
- AmazonBasics Executive chair $80: https://is.gd/Jt47Xq 
- Internet speed: I have the 250mb d/l. I suggest this as a bare minimum especially if you live with other folks competing for bandwidth. We will probably have Frozen streaming 24x7 over here
- Noise cancelling headphones. Listen without distracting others and keep from being distracted by others
- I work in a distraction free room with lots of sunlight, no TV, no phone.
- I have all the cords, connectors, and adapters I will need
- Verify the VPN works and I can connect with all my internal work resources from home

Amazon has 1 day shipping, or same-day shipping if you live in the city. I suggest buying from Amazon, and then burn the boxes. Those boxes are filthy.

Many of these peripherals and tools aren't needed for the short term, but I wouldn't want to work without them for more than a week. The second monitor increases productivity, per se, just by virtue of less toggling between browser and code editor.

One thing that is indispensable is a distraction free work environment. The office is filled with many distractions. However a home can be filled with many more. Whereas distractions in the office may lead to productivity gains, distractions in my home usually look like timesucks. By sequestering myself to the best of my ability, I set the stage for productivity beyond what I achieved in the office.



## How To Work

A distraction free work environment allows me to work productively. Effective communication enables me to work collaboratively. Remote communication introduces a reduction in "signal" due to the lack of body language, cues, and signaling we might transmit in person. In any event, I suggest overcommunication between team members until distributed-team communication norms are established and everyone is on the same page. Even then, overcommunication can be used as an effective tool to combat ambiguity, opacity, and misconceptions.

Here are a few ways in which we communicate and over communicate.

### Stand-Up Meetings

The morning "stand-up" meetings provide a 10 minute forum for our teammates to discuss what is on their plate, and, more importantly, obstacles in their way.

### Information Depot

We have many places where information is stored:
- JIRA
- Confluence
- Stash
- AHA!
- Sharepoint
- Email
- Slack
- [your teams tool here]

    Our team has decided to use JIRA tickets and Confluence as our source-of-truth. When information is scoped to a specific task, it may be stored in JIRA, otherwise it is (somewhere) in Confluence. I assume your team has a "source of truth" for your particular domain knowledge, but if not consider using one, if only for the short-term.

    Whenever there are meetings, whether it is one-on-one, video, audio, or async slack chats, we, as a team, do our best to distill what was discussed and add or adjust information and/or specific details to the relevant JIRA tickets and/or Confluence Pages.

### Slack Channels

The engineering team makes use of Slack channels. We have long-lived channels for the engineering team at large, as well as regional channels, channels for automated messages from a server, like the status of the build, channels for light-hearted water-cooler talk like "random", ad-hoc channels whenever there is a all-hands-on-deck hotfix required, and channels for individual team discussions. Slack channels are amazing for async/sync discussions, be they evergreen or ephemeral. 

These channels are fantastic for the collaborative, streaming, and evolving nature of the specific topics discussed within them. Just as we do with a standard meeting, anything, and everything, of note goes into our JIRA tickets or Confluence pages.

Links to the relevant Confluence pages or JIRA tickets are frequently posted in a Slack channel, if only to say "look here for the information we just discussed."

### Ask and/or Confirm

Remote communication tends to result in a few dropped balls before norms are established. Efficacy reverts to a mean; however, remote communication has not been shown to replace the fidelity of in-person communication. Facial expressions, body language, subtext, whatever... I will stop preaching, but you get the message...

__Ask questions.__ When I think I have something understood the first time, I should probably double-check. Furthermore, _asking specific questions around the boundaries_ of the topic help me to clarify the overall purpose, intent, and expected outcome of what is being requested or discussed. I have to put the quality of my understanding ahead of my fear that I will look like I wasn't paying attention, or that I am simply a daft individual.

__Confirm what I think I know.__ Confirming what the team has asked of me is another opportunity to overcommunicate. Having worked with my team for a while, we are decent at art of effective communication, however I can, still, hear what I want to hear, or blank at the wrong time during a discussion. Confirming what I heard, mitigates misinterpretation and miscommunication, while providing opportunity for clarity and honing in on salient points of the discussion.

### Persistence and Chasing Down Info

When working remotely, it's very inconvenient to chase down people and, alternative, very convenient to fire off an email and wait...and wait... and...wait.

Being persistent can feel like an annoyance at best and hovering at worst, so I try to be gentle. At the end of the day, I need status updates on ongoing work, especially when this work blocks my work. As stated, communication can get dropped, so if I haven't heard back from someone, I will reach out and bug them.

If I reach out to someone who doesn't have an answer, I ask this person for a new lead, or backtrack to the previous lead and ask for a new one. Sooner or later, I will find someone who knows something.


### Write "as if" I am going on vacation for a few weeks

I write with as much detail, in _unambiguous and certain terms_, as possible. if I were leaving for three weeks and completely unreachable, my coworker could finish the work in my absence.

That aforementioned statement is a complete lie. I try to write that way, however it is easier said than done. The upshot of getting into this habit is not only for continuity's sake, but effective writing is the most powerful tool to eliminating the need for folks to ask you questions and confirm misconceptions and assumptions. So... _I try_ to write this way.


### Show, Don't Tell w/ Screencap Videos

I use screen capture software like "LiceCap" (https://licecap.en.softonic.com/) to show small bits of functionality to my team. For more involved demos, I use OBS (open broadcaster software). Email me if you want the OBS How-To doc.

My teammates cannot simply roll over to my desk. If they are available for a screenshare, that is an option. More often than not, I find it more helpful to use screen capture videos as a form of documentation. Screen captures can be attached to ongoing documentation or uploaded to Slack for individuals to view at their time.

### Let my team know where I am

We _try_ to make effective use of our calendars and away messages. Calling out my planned absences in our team calendar allows folks to see when I am going to be gone. Setting away messages let people know when I am in a meeting or, otherwise, away from the keyboard. If I am taking an early or late lunch this is, usually, communicated in the slack channel. My hope is that at least a few of my team members know where I am during and around work hours.

### Staying engaged

I have to stay engaged as a team member. I can easily isolate when working from home. Even if I am being productive, I find it very important to stay connected with my team on a personal level. Staying engaged takes on enumerable forms. Sometimes this looks like writing my "dad joke of the day" in the team Slack channel, every morning. It might look like reaching out to a team member and asking what they are doing. If they are stuck, or just willing to pair, I will work with them. Other times I might post something tech related that I read, or sparking some watercooler talk. Ultimately the goal is to recreate the dynamism and fun of the office environment for the online environment.

### Final Tips

I use a Chrome plugin called “Strict Workflow” that is, both, a website blocker and a Pomodoro time. I set the work time for 45 minutes. Much of the time, I don’t need it, however it is a great tool that forced me into the habit of getting into flow.

Lastly, a lot of grazing can occur between big and small tasks, alike. I keep a sleeve of Oreos in the pantry. I can no longer trust myself with the family size Oreos.
