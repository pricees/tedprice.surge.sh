### tl;dr 

If I am running or cycling across an intersection, I can only trust two behaviors:

- The vehicle is clearly decelerating as to come to a complete stop at the light or intersection.
- Getting acknowledgment from the diver that they see me

### The real talk

Believe it or not, I have been running for quite some. I mean, yeah, I got a gut, whatever. 

No matter where I run, almost daily, I encounter dangerous drivers. I have learned to never put any
trust in non-human indicators, be it stop lights or walking signals, and my kids will learn the
same.

Over the past decade I have lived in Chicago (the city), and Simsbury, CT (the country), and I encounter the exact same peril:

- Drivers looking at their cellphones and proceeding to run red lights long after they have been red.
- Drivers lost in thought, whilst looking forward, running red lights
- Drivers looking around the car for some item, running red lights
- Drivers, at a full stop, turning onto a main road, after only looking at the oncoming traffic (that is left, here in the states), and not double checking for walkers
- Drivers coming up onto an intersection looking only at oncoming then gunning it onto a turn so
    that they can beat the oncoming traffic, not checking for cross walkers.
- Drivers speeding to "make the yellow" only to speed through a red.
- _...and so on and so forth...

So the name of the game is this: make sure that the driver sees me or I wait until I have all but
eliminated the chance for an accident. I used to joke that the American dream was to get side-swiped
by a Rolls Royce. The reality is that accidents occur, the cyclist and runner are left injured, and much of
the time these accidents can be avoided by dropping expectations and practicing extra prevention and awareness.
