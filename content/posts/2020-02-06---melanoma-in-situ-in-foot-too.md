Over 25 years ago, in Hawaii, I was walking out in the ocean and stepped on a sea urchin. It hurt.
Really bad. I remember looking at my feet and seeing a few dots. It looked like a blood blister.

As time went on, I didn't pay much attention to those dots. They grew slowly as if not at all. 
I just figured these dots were a part of me. I had plenty of physicals, doctors never said anything.

Last month, we visited my mother for Christmas. She saw my foot and said: "Go have a doctor check
that out." 

I made an appointment and saw a doctor who cut the flesh right out, same appointment.

The biopsy came back positive. *Melanoma In Situ*, a.k.a. pre-cancer, a.k.a. _Stage 0_.

There is nothing in the world that has ever so quickly affected my perspective on life than the doctor
telling me that I tested positive for anything even remotely related to a cancer.

I didn't fall to pieces. I didn't really know what it was. It was like, well, I guess this is my
life now. He said it wasn't too bad, but he was cautious in tone.

I looked on-line. There is a lot of information about _In Situ_, however the most important info was:

Melanoma In Situ is not Melanoma. My skin has cancer cells. But I do not have cancer.

Tomorrow I have a consultation visit to prepare to have 0.5mm of skin, down to the muscle, removed from the
arch of my foot. I will be on my back for 48 hours and will be unable to doing anything active for
at least a month. My doctor said I would be checking in with dermatologists every three months for
two years, and then every once in a while for the rest of my life.

....rest of my life.

Well that kinda changes things doesn't it?

Thank God for health insurance and quality medical care.
