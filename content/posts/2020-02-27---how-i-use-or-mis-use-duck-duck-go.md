One of my 2018 resolutions was to use DuckDuckGo exclusively. That didn't happen. Two years later, I
have found a way to make it work.

A true assessment of my use-cases and getting comfortable with DDG
[!bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bang) have made it very easy to use as my default search engine.

A few of the bang commands I use frequently:

```
!g cigar lounge near me # escape hatch to Google search engine for a cigar lounge
!rails validations      # search rails docs for validations
!hn rust                # search for rust HackerNews submissions
!yt morning meditation  # search youtube for morning meditation
!sr heavyseas           # heavyseas subreddit
```

With Google, I essentially type in whatever cames to my mind semantically, "why time does MdDonald's open?"
Google is very good about understanding my intention based on the data it collects.

DuckDuckGo requires some additional information if I want specificity.

For example:

search term: `Big Sky Gym`

Google knows I am searching from Simsbury, CT. The result is high quality information about the local gym include maps, hours, web page and contact.

With DDG, Ted-agnostic, it responds with gyms in Big Sky, Montana. The price you pay for privacy.

No biggie. Slight adjustment required.

For most of my usage patterns, where I scope my search to a known domain. DuckDuckGo's bang
expressions cut out an additional noise and make this type of operation much quicker than Google.
When I am truly searching for information, source agnostic, DuckDuckGo's information is generally
good enough.
When I need higher quality results, however, I use the `!g` to see what Google has to say.

DuckDuckGo satisfies my needs say 75% of the time.

Search rules:

- If I know the specific domain, DDG bang expressions win.
- If I need a good general search, and don't know where to start, Google wins.
- The grey area in between? Start with DDG, move to Google.

I like DDG. I will stick with it.

Next on my list is to move off Chrome to Firefox.
